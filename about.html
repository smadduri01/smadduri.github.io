                <h1>Welcome to WasteMaster</h1>

                <p>This application created by four college sophomores, Sri Siddhartha Madduri, Hari Siddhi Natraj Sankaranarayanan, Ameya Mandale, and Dhatchinamoorthi Kunde Govindarajan provides a solution to improper waste management amongst individuals. This entire process was created within a day at a hackathon event called CruzHacks, during the pandemic. </p>

                <p>The way to use the application is as simple as it sounds. Just simply upload a JPEG or PNG file of an image of an item that you don't know where to throw, and the WasteMaster will provide you where to throw the item. It answers all your problems in improper waste managment and helps you become more environmentally conscious!</p>

                <p>Aspiring for a better future!</p>
